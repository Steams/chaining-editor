* BUGS
*** DONE if u type the same letter twice u cant backspace the duplicate

* TODO
** DONE Backspacing the previous word entry
** DONE Manual place cursor
*** Text area containing spans of each char and input for current
*** TODO Text area, followed by input, followed by text div
**** type in input, on space add text to textbox on left and add unremovable letter then fresh input after,
**** on change, render out representation of new list, ziplist with old list, if they match keep, if not put old list starter in that pos
**** position at first vacant slot
**** Limitation : cant make starting letters in previous words non editable, would have to do individual inputs for that
*** List of inputs

** DONE Periods don’t need to be part of the chain, so no repeating punctuation (all punctuation)
*** TODO write tests for punctuations
** DONE Double letter error (I’m able to totally delete the two letters but that would break the chain)
** DONE handle mouse select and delete multiple aswell. (dont just heck if new string = old string - head, check if newstring = oldstring - (old length - newlength)

** TODO New text needs to populate somewhere else. It’s going ‘behind’ the entry lines and I can’t read it. New text on top, and entry point at bottom?
*** TODO Having the entry point shift over as the paragraph progresses, much like the cursor normally would in a regular text editor
*** TODO Having the entry point not exist inside the paragraph itself, but below the text area
*** TODO button to switch between these modes

** TODO Button to start new chain and end previous
*** Insert a button to start a new chain on a new paragraph ??

** TODO A new line or paragraph should continue the the existing chain
*** TODO Support \n multiplline : on enter, append \n to end of current string. Ask how he wants enter to be handled
*** TODO make entire area a text area, make prev a text area, make input input, post is just text
*** TODO on \n entry, end current word like space, (if empty ignore), add \n to prev text area, continue

** TODO COPY button
** TODO Text entry field needs to expand for long new text so it doesnt go under the prefix list



** DONE Cannot backspace first letter of generated word
** DONE Edit previous word and regenerate
** DONE Stop backspace of first newchar, same logic as on renrender

* On rerender
** DONE Stop first letter deletion
*** when change, check which word in current str is different from old
*** if its first character that changed, dont allow
*** if its a different char that changed, then proceed to regenerate
*** generate layout structure (all the letters in order) from new sentence, then check if each word first char matches the char at its positioin in list,
*** stop at the first word that doesnt match, and start input from there
** DONE regenerate new prefix list and check each word againsts its prefix
*** DONE stop on the first fail
*** DONE use the rest of the prefix list as the words themself for the rest of the model
